    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I was born in Bangladesh and currently a student at City College of New York. I am expecting to graduate 2025 with a Bachelors of Engineering in Computer Science and a minor in Business Administration. I want to continue to develop my skills as a software engineer and inevitably make impact on millions of people with my code. I enjoy putting myself in uncomfortable situations as that's when I see the most growth. On my free time, I like conversing with people, watch anime, play soccer, running, and go for walks. I love working with technology, both software and hardware, as it's fascinating to see different things function together to give a certain result. One of my favorite and most impactful book of all time is "Can't Hurt Me" by David Goggins.</p>
